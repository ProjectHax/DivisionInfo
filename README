Silkroad Division Parser/Editor

Requirements:
Visual Studio 2010
Boost
Qt

Known Issues:
There might be a slight issue when trying to open large Media.pk2
files. It will spit out an error telling you there is not enough
memory. No clue why this happens since there is plenty of address
space for an 850MB PK2 file. And if you try to open a PK2 file
a couple times eventually it will open the file successfully.
Again, I have no idea what the problem is.


Don't forget to update the boost folder in the settings to your own
otherwise you won't be able to compile it.
